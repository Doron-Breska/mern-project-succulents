        <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly
          used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on
          meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available.
          It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers
          to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
          Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum,
          a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered,
              added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.</p>
